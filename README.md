# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Write a description the personal interest or problem that your animation addresses. Then explain the user story(s) you identified, and how they help frame making your animation.

- I love playing soccer and watching soccer wherever and whenever! One of my favortite and most iconic moments was when Manchester United won the Champions league Final in 2008. Even though I wasn't even born yet, I've watched that specific game, too many times that I've lost count. The game was filled with action, drama, and pressure in every minute. So, looking back I decided to make a project showcasing when one of my favorite teams won. It is the last penalty and the opposing team misses, meaning that Manchester Wins as you can see on the code. The user story helps shape my project as it gives a clear goal and purpose to what I'm making.I'm telling a real story that means something to me. The part where the opposing team misses the penalty and Manchester United wins is the emotional highlight, and my animation focuses on that exact moment. It brings drama, tension, and victory all in one scene! Just like in the actual match.
